# Running analysis

This repo contains analysis and application code for running analytics. As a first project, I have done `stride vs. candence` analysis, where I tried to build an app, that would help to make decisin between Asics Metaspeed Sky and Endge shoes. It might in interesting in general as well.

If you have any suggestions about the improvements to the above mentioned analytics or a suggestion to do something else, I am very interested to hear your thoughts. You can reach me via email: vaidas (dot) armonas (at) gmail (dot) com.
