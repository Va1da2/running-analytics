When Asics released their first super shows - MetaSpeed Sky and Edge - I was a bit confused about the whole stride 
vs cadence distinction. I was not sure (although I had an idea) where I fall on this spectrum although I went ahead 
and bought myself a Sky variant. From a quick glance at my data, it looked close - I increased both my cadence 
as well as stride length.

With the release of the updated Sky+ & Edge+, they also released (or I noticed them this time) some graphs where 
Asics give a bit more concrete explanation about the distinction between a `Stride` and `Cadence` runners 
(see the graphs below that I have found on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/mgjxmc/asics_distinguishes_stride_runners_vs_cadence/))

A few observations from the above graphs:

1. These are very fast runners.
2. There is quite a big difference between the two runners, but these might be cherry-picked graphs to illustrate the differences.
3. Since paces are fast, it is not obvious that this translates well for slower runners.
4. I haven't seen such a graph as part of the regular Garmin/Strava activity analytics set.

To see how the stride and cadence differ for me (and others), I have created this app. All you need to do is to provide
a `.fit` file that you can download from your Garmin connect application (Or you can see how the analysis looks for my Mitching workout by checking the `Use demo data` checkbox).
You can provide multiple files if you wish. The main consideration should be the range of paces. For this analysis to be meaningful,
there needs to be a range of paces and associated stride lengths and cadences. I used the Michigan workout to develop this
because it features a lot of different paces - easy pace for warm-up, tempo, 10k, 5k, and 3k paces for the workout sets.

Since I am using a Garmin watch, I used `.fit` files. If you use a different platform and would like to see this analysis, you could provide me with the data of your activity and
I will expand this app to allow for other types of input files.

    Hopefully, your graph indicates which type of runner you are.

    If you have selected demo data - I am in between (especially when weighing laps by their distance - advanced option). My stride length and cadence increase at about the same rate.
    I would be interested to hear about your experience!
